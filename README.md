# Language Extensions
A bunch of Chrome Extensions for learning Chinese that I developed for a friend. More specifically, three extensions. And all three of them are pretty much the same thing, but with a different set of words.

* Anna's Logophile
* Chinese Radicals
* It's over Nine Thousand

All words also have audio. Audio was generated automatically by putting the word in Google Translate and recording the audio. A simple Python program did all the work. Very satisfying to watch thousands of audio files being generated automatically without any work needed on your end. :)

The extensions will change your New Tab page to a page where you will be shown a random word and will have to guess the correct meaning. You can click on "Show Meaning" to see what the meaning was. This way, you can passively absorb information and learn new things. This concept goes beyond language learning. We all use browsers a lot, and naturally we open a lot of new tabs. If we see a new piece of information each time we open a new tab, imagine how smart one could get over the course of days, weeks, and months. Since the average person opens probably hundreds of new tabs every day, the results would be that much faster. If that sounds like you, you could learn a lot in just a day or two.

This is what the extensions look like: ![Anna's Logophile](https://i.imgur.com/Cmg6Z4t.png) 
As you can see, it has a pretty basic design, nothing too fancy. You can't add words right now, since the person I made this for just had a list of words on Wikipedia and othre websites which I simply scraped for him. Perhaps, in the future, I might add the ability to add your own words in the extension.

## Installation Instructions
Installing these extensions is quite simple. Even though they're not available in the official Chrome store, because they were a personal project only, installing them is still a simple drag-and-drop process.
1. Start by downloading the Extension folder from this GitHub repository.
2. Open the Chrome extensions page and drag the folder in there. It should give you the option to install them.

Contact me if you run into any issues. Though this is such a basic process, a simple Google search will get it working in less than a minute.
